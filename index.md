Now, I am a Ph.D. student at Nanjing University of Science and Technology under supervision of Prof. [Jinhui Tang](https://imag-njust.net/jinhui-tang/). During Sep. 2018 to Sep. 2020, I was supported by China Scholarship Council as a joint PhD. student at Nanyang Technological University under supervision of [Hanwang Zhang](https://mreallab.github.io/people.html) in Singapore. My research interests are in machine learning and computer vision, especially in object detection and semantic segmentation.
